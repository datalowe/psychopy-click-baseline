Psychopy Click Response Times Experiment
=========================================

This is a [PsychoPy](https://psychopy.org/) project consisting of an experimental task with trials where the participant is prompted to click numbers in ascending order. Its main purpose is to measure participants' click response times, which can then be used for generating a baseline to which response times for other experiments can be compared.

Placement of target numbers is randomly generated in a way that prevents overlapping targets. 

Upon being clicked, targets change color, making it easier for participants to see what targets they have left.

Most experiment specifications, e. g. target size or number of trials, are done in a code snippet linked to the first routine (in the Builder interface).

The instructions and end message are in Swedish. This can easily be replaced by using PsychoPy's Builder interface.
